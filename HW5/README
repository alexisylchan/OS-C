HW5.c :
Starts the 4 processes to process characters from input stream or file (if given a file as an argument into the parent process).
First process reads character from input stream.
Second process strips newlines and replace them with spaces.
Third process strips consecutive asterixes and replace them with ^ .
Fourth process sends 80 character lines (81 if including newline character) to output stream which is stdout.


Testing:
- To compile: 
  gcc HW5.c  -o HW5
- To test from stdin:
  HW5
- To test with all test files:
  test_all.csh
- To check differences from the test results with standard test results:
  diff_all.csh
