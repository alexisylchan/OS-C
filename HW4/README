Buffer files:
A bounded-buffer abstract type to encapsulate all of the implementation details of the buffer and export functions "deposit" and "remove"

- buffer.h
- buffer.c

Processing file:
Starts the 4 threads to process characters from input stream or file (if given a file as an argument into the running process). 
First thread reads character from input stream. 
Second thread strips newlines and replace them with spaces.
Third thread strips consecutive asterixes and replace them with ^ .
Fourth thread sends 80 character lines (81 if including newline character) to output stream which is stdout.
- HW4.c

Testing:
- To compile: 
  gcc HW4.c buffer.c libst.a semaphore.o -o HW4
- To test from stdin:
  HW4
- To test with all test files:
  test_all.csh
- To check differences from the test results with standard test results:
  diff_all.csh
